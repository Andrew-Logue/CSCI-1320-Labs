Lab 6 Debug Explanations

helloWorldBuggy.cpp
1) need to cite: using namespace std; prior to the main funciton
   so that cout and endl can be used
2) the final return statement in the main function is missing 
   a closing semicolon

circleAreaBuggy.cpp
1) the variable 'radius' was defined as constant, it must be
   changed to be declared as a regular double type in order to 
   be assigned a new value via user input
2) the variable 'area' was not assigned a variable type, it must
   be assigned a variable type, initializing area as a double type
   would be the most logical solution

calculatorBuggy.cpp
1) if num2 is set to 0 by the user, then a floating point 
   exception error will occur, use a warning message and an 
   if statement to make sure the user does not enter 0 for num2
2) initializing num1 and num2 as double types would be much
   more effective for the division portion of the main funciton

freeFallBuggy.cpp
1) no user input is recieved by the main function, a cin >>
   state must be added like the following:
   cin >> t;
   *note: variable t must be initialized as a regular int not 
   a constant first*
1) varibale 'g' should be initialized as a const double type,
   otherwise it will hold the value 9 instead of the desired 9.8
2) the equation for calculating the freefall distance is wrong, 
   varibale 't' should be squared, and '1/2' should be simplified
   to '.5'
   to do this, first include cmath before the main function:
   #include <cmath>
   then fix the equation by including the imported power funciton:
   d = .5 * g * pow(t, 2);

powersBuggy.cpp
1) include cmath
   #include <cmath>
2) cin >> x;
3) the incrementation of the powers of 'x' is wrong:
   varibale a should be initialized as 1 not 2, and should
   increase by 1 for each "x to the power of " statement, not
   the " is equal to " statements, for example:
   int x, a=1;
   cout << "x to the power of " << ++a;
   cout << " is equal to " << pow(x,a) << endl;
